The Excellence Program for Heavy Vehicle Drivers was also abolished on that date. Please refer to the page regarding the [revisions that have been made to the conduct review policies for heavy vehicle owners, operators and drivers](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/conduct-review-policies) for more information.\n\n## Conduct Review Policy for Heavy Vehicle Drivers\n\nThe goals of the _Conduct Review Policy for Heavy Vehicle Drivers_ are to:\n\n- identify drivers of heavy vehicles who pose a risk to road safety and the integrity of the road network\n- intervene with the drivers concerned in order for them to change their behaviour and adopt safer conduct\n\n### Who is subject to the _Conduct Review Policy for Heavy Vehicle Drivers_?\n\nAll heavy vehicle drivers:\n\n- who hold a driver's licence issued in Québec\n\nAND\n- who operate anywhere in Canada a heavy vehicle registered in Québec\n\n### Monitoring the conduct of heavy vehicle drivers\n\nWe keep a record on every heavy vehicle driver who has been involved in an event related to road safety or the integrity of the road network while at the wheel of a heavy vehicle registered in Québec. This record allows us to [monitor each driver's conduct](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/conduct-record).\n\n### Ongoing conduct review of heavy vehicle drivers\n\nThe conduct review of heavy vehicle drivers is carried out on the basis of 4 conduct areas:\n\n- \"Traffic Rules\"\n- \"Use of a Heavy Vehicle\"\n- \"Involvement in Accidents\"\n- \"Driver's Overall Conduct\"\n\nEach event entered in a driver's record is assigned a weighting based on its degree of severity.\n\nThe points associated with the events are compiled in the relevant conduct area. For each conduct area, we have established a number of points that must not be reached (threshold value).\n\nSome events are not weighted, because they are considered critical events and result in an immediate intervention on our part.\n\n### Interventions by the SAAQ\n\nIf your record deteriorates, we inform you of that fact in a series of gradually escalating steps, in order for you to rectify your behaviour.\n\nIf your conduct record continues to deteriorate, it is referred to the [Commission des transports du Québec⁠ ⁠](https://www.ctq.gouv.qc.ca/english/), which may impose corrective measures or even prohibit you from driving a heavy vehicle.\n\n**Immediate interventions**\n\nWe intervene immediately when you are involved in a serious or critical event, a fatal accident, or an event related to alcohol-impaired driving.\n\nFor more information on the weighting of events, critical events, threshold values and intervention mechanisms, consult the [Conduct Review Policy for Heavy Vehicle Drivers.
