The Excellence Program for Heavy Vehicle Drivers was also abolished on that date. Please refer to the page regarding the [revisions that have been made to the conduct review policies for heavy vehicle owners, operators and drivers](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/conduct-review-policies) for more information.\n\nThe information found in the conduct record of drivers of heavy vehicles is provided in 2 documents:\n\n- **Monitoring of Heavy Vehicle Driver Conduct**\n- **Information Concerning the Driver's Record**\n\n## _Monitoring of Heavy Vehicle Driver Conduct_ document\n\nThis document presents a heavy vehicle driver's conduct record by conduct area, and specifies the number of points that must not be reached (called the “threshold value”) for each conduct area, in accordance with the [Conduct Review Policy for Heavy Vehicle Drivers⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/conduct-review-policy-hvd.pdf \"\"). It includes any events related to driving heavy vehicles registered in Québec that are operated in Canada.\n\nThe document provides details of **any events related to the actions of a heavy vehicle driver while that person was on duty**, regardless of which operator was using that driver's services when the events occurred.\n\nThe document provides information about the following:\n\n- any critical events triggering an immediate referral of the driver's record to the [Commission des transports du Québec⁠ ⁠](https://www.ctq.gouv.qc.ca/english/) (CTQ)\n- any critical alcohol- or drug-related driving offences\n- any accidents in which the driver was involved, and the number of points associated with each accident\n- any other offences and any out-of-service orders, as well as the associated number of points\n- the total number of points accumulated by the driver in each conduct area\n- any prohibition from driving a heavy vehicle ordered by the [CTQ⁠ ⁠](https://www.ctq.gouv.qc.ca/english/)\n\nEvents remain in the conduct record for 2 years, except for events related to alcohol- or drug-related driving offences, which remain in the record for 10 years.\n\n### Obtaining a copy of the _Monitoring of Heavy Vehicle Driver Conduct_ document\n\nA copy of your conduct record is provided:\n\n- upon request (online, in person, by email, by phone or by mail)\n- as part of an intervention on our part\n\n### How to request a conduct record\n\n#### Online\n\nHeavy vehicle drivers can now obtain a copy of their conduct record via [SAAQclic⁠ ⁠](https://saaqclic.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/saaqstorefront/en/login).\n\nTo access their conduct record, heavy vehicle drivers must select “My Driving Record” in the left menu, and then “Obtaining Information Regarding My Driving.”\n\nWe highly recommend that heavy vehicle drivers download an updated copy of their conduct record, even if they obtained a copy relatively recently (prior to May 8), because a number of adjustments have been made in recent weeks.\n\nConduct records are updated whenever adjustments are made, with the updated version ready for download the following day. Conduct records are also automatically updated every 7 days.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the latest edition of _Le Relayeur_ (in French only): [Disponibilité des états de dossier des PEVL et des suivis de comportement des CVL.](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transport-biens/le-relayeur/disponibilite-etats-dossier-pevl-suivis-comportement-cvl)\n\nIf you are unable to use our online services but would like to request a copy of your conduct record or have any questions, you can contact us:\n\n- in person: at any of our service centres\n- by email: [courrier@saaq.gouv.qc.ca This link opens your default email software.](mailto:courrier@saaq.gouv.qc.ca \"\")\n- by phone: 1-800-554-4814, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday\n- by mail:\n\nDirection des politiques, de la performance et des relations avec le milieu\n\nSociété de l'assurance automobile du Québec\n\n333, boul.
