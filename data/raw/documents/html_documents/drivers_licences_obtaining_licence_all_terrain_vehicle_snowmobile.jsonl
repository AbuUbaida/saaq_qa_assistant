You must also abide by the conditions associated with the licence you hold.\n\n## What qualifies as an off-road vehicle\n\n- **Snowmobiles**\n- The following motorized all-terrain vehicles:\n  - **quad bikes**\n  - **recreational off-road vehicles**\n  - **all-terrain motorcycles**, including motocross bikes\n- Other motorized all-terrain vehicles designed or adapted to be operated on uneven or unpaved terrain or terrain that is difficult to access, especially surfaces covered with snow, ice, earth, sand or gravel, as well as in wooded areas and other natural environments.\n\n## Operating off-road vehicles\n\nOn a public road, trail, or any other area of use that is not covered by the _Highway Safety Code_, you must:\n\n- hold a valid driver’s licence or probationary licence of any class, or hold a valid learner’s licence and abide by its conditions (that you be accompanied and not carry passengers)\n- be at least 16 years old\n- be at least 18 years old if the vehicle is a recreational off-road vehicle\n- be at least 18 years old if you are carrying a passenger on a quad bike that has been modified by the addition of an add-on seat\n\n**Drive safely**\n\nTo safely enjoy your [snowmobile](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/snowmobile/what-law-says) or [all-terrain vehicle](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/all-terrain-vehicle/what-law-says) outings, it is important to obey the law and drive responsibly.\n\n## Training certificate for 16- and 17-year old drivers\n\nIf you are **16 or 17 and want to drive a snowmobile or an all-terrain vehicle**, you must have a **training certificate**.\n\nThe certificate is issued after completing the mandatory training that all new drivers should follow, regardless of their age.\n\n### For snowmobiles\n\nThis training is given by [ConduiPro network of driving schools⁠ ⁠](http://www.conduipro.com/) (website in French only). You can also contact the [Fédération des clubs de motoneigistes du Québec⁠ ⁠](http://fcmq.qc.ca/?lang=en).\n\n### for all-terrain vehicles (quad bikes, trail bikes, etc.), with the exception of recreational off-road vehicles\n\nThe training is given by certified monitors listed on the [Fédération québécoise des clubs quads⁠ ⁠](http://www.fqcq.qc.ca/en/) website.\n\nNote that for complementary information on the rules you must follow when riding a trail bike in parks and on trails, you can contact the [Fédération québécoise des motos hors route⁠ ⁠](http://www.fqmhr.qc.ca/en/) or refer to their website. The Fédération can also let you know which of Québec’s federated trails you can ride on with your trail bike.\n\n### For recreational off-highway vehicles\n\nA training certificate is not required to drive a recreational off-road vehicle because you can only drive that type of vehicle if you are 18 or older.\n\n**If you are 16 or 17 and live outside Québec**\n\nYou do not need to obtain a training certificate, provided you hold a driver’s licence issued by the appropriate authority in your home jurisdiction (e.g. an Ontario driver’s licence).\n\nLast update: July 16, 2025\n\n- ## See also\n\n  - [Young Drivers – Snowmobiles, All-Terrain Vehicles and Other Off-Road Vehicles](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/client-groups/young-drivers/snowmobile-all-terrain-off-road-vehicles)\n  - [Snowmobiles: What the Law Says](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/snowmobile/what-law-says)\n  - [All-Terrain Vehicles: What the Law Says](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/all-terrain-vehicle/what-law-says)\n- ## Other websites\n\n  - [Fédération québécoise des clubs quads⁠ ⁠](http://www.fqcq.qc.ca/en/)\n  - [Fédération québécoise des motos hors route⁠ ⁠](http://www.soishorsroute.ca/en/)\n  - [Fédération des clubs de motoneigistes du Québec⁠ ⁠](http://fcmq.qc.ca/?lang=en)\n  - [ConduiPro⁠ ⁠](http://www.conduipro.com/) (in French only)\n  - [Ministère des Transports⁠ ⁠](https://www.transports.gouv.qc.ca/en/Pages/Home.aspx)\n- ## Laws and regulations\n\n\n\n  - [Act respecting off-highway vehicles⁠ ⁠](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showDoc/cs/V-1.3?&digest=)\n\n- ## Publications\n\n\n[Sortir en toute sécurité⁠ ⁠](https://www.transports.gouv.qc.ca/fr/entreprises-partenaires/associations-VHR/loi-vehicules-hors-route/Documents/sortir-en-toute-securite.pdf) (in French only)\n\n\n## Safety first, on the road and online\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy.
