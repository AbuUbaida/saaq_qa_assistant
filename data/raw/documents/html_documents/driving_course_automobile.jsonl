It is recommended that you review the course material independently to make sure you have a thorough understanding of what has been covered. For example, you can practise by completing the exercises applicable to the modules seen in class.\n\nThe practical component consists of 15 in-car sessions of approximately 1 hour each. Before each outing, the instructor will discuss manoeuvres to perform and behaviours to adopt. At the end of the lesson, you and the instructor will discuss:\n\n- your strengths\n- things to improve\n- the elements to put into practice during your next in-car sessions\n\nThe 12 modules are divided into 4 phases.\n\n### Phase 1 : 28-day minimum duration\n\nAfter you pass Phase 1, you may obtain your learner’s licence. You must have acquired the concepts presented in the following documents:\n\n- [Module 1 – The Vehicle](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-1-vehicle)\n- [Module 2 – The Driver](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-2-driver)\n- [Module 3 – The Environment](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-3-environment)\n- [Module 4 – At-Risk Behaviours](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-4-at-risk-behaviours)\n- [Module 5 – Evaluation](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-5-evaluation)\n\nYour learner’s licence is required to begin in-car sessions in Phase 2. For more information on obtaining your learner’s licence, visit [Obtaining a Driver’s Licence: Automobile (Class 5)](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/obtaining-licence/passenger-vehicle-class-5).\n\n### Phase 2 : 28-day minimum duration\n\nFor your first in-car guided sessions, you must be familiar with the concepts presented in the following documents:\n\n- [Module 6 – Accompanied Driving](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-6-accompanied-driving)\n- [Module 7 – OEA Driving Strategy](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-7-oea-driving-strategy)\n\n### Phase 3 : 56-day minimum duration\n\nFor your semi-guided in-car sessions, you must be familiar with the concepts presented in the following documents:\n\n- [Module 8 – Speed](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-8-speed)\n- [Module 9 – Sharing the Road](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-9-sharing-road)\n- [Modules 10 – Alcohol and Drugs](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-10-alcohol-drugs)\n\n### Phase 4 : 56-day minimum duration\n\nFor your transition to independent driving in-car sessions, you must be familiar with the concepts presented in the following documents:\n\n- [Module 11 – Fatigue and Distractions](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-11-fatigue-distractions)\n- [Module 12 – Eco-Driving](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/automobile/module-12-eco-driving)\n\nBefore your in-car sessions, your instructor will ask you to watch the video clip associated with the relevant module. Video clips are also available in the [Preparation for On-Road Instruction (PPTX, 63.9 MB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/cours-conduite/preparation-on-road-instruction.pptx) presentation.\n\nFormative on-road evaluations are done by the instructor during in-car sessions 5, 10 and 15. In-car session 15 is the summary session before the SAAQ road test.\n\n## Schematic of the Course Structure\n\n![This image shows the distribution of the course modules, their titles and the related in-car sessions.](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/images/permis/etapes-cours-conduite-en.png)\n\n## SAAQ tests and the driver’s licence\n\nTo prepare for the SAAQ tests or to learn about the process for obtaining your licence, visit [Obtaining a Passenger Vehicle Driver's Licence (Class 5)](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/obtaining-licence/passenger-vehicle-class-5) or consult [the quick reference guide to obtaining a passenger vehicle (Class 5) driver’s licence (PDF, 469.6 KB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/permis-conduire/reference-guide-licence-classe-5.pdf).\n\nLast update: May 30, 2024\n\n- ## See also\n\n  - [Find a Recognized Driving School](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/finding-recognized-driving-school)\n  - [Frequently Asked Questions](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/frequently-asked-questions)\n  - [Obtaining a Driver's Licence](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/obtaining-licence/passenger-vehicle-class-5)\n\n## Safety first, on the road and online\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy.
