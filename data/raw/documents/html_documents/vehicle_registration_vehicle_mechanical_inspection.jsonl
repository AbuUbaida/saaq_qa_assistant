Mechanical inspections are mandatory to obtain or retain the right to operate certain vehicles.\n\n### What are the limits of the inspection?\n\nThe mechanical inspection is limited to those components listed in the [Road Vehicle Mechanical Inspection Guide (PDF, 9.6 MB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/mechanical-inspection-guide.pdf).\n\nFor a more in-depth assessment of the mechanical condition of your vehicle, it is recommended that you also have your mechanic carry out a mechanical inspection.\n\n#### Before the inspection\n\nYou must [make an appointment](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet).\n\nMake sure that your vehicle:\n\n- is not loaded\n- is free of dirt and any other substance (ice, grease, rust, etc.) that may prevent a complete visual inspection of all of the vehicle's components\n\nLast update: January 12, 2024\n\n## Safety first, on the road and online\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy.
