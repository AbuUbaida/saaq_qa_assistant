Here are the most common cases:\n\n- a vehicle sold by a dealer\n- a stored vehicle acquired by a dealer, a non-resident of Québec or someone else\n- a mechanical inspection\n- a vehicle registered for operation in a location that is not connected to the Québec road network\n- a trip permit for a heavy vehicle\n- a recalibration of the advanced driver assistance systems after a severely damaged vehicle has been rebuilt\n\nFor more information on other situations where you could obtain a temporary registration certificate, consult the [Politique sur l'immatriculation temporaire (PDF, 201.3 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/acces-information/immatriculation-temporaire.pdf) (in French only) or [phone us](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/reach-us).\n\n### A temporary registration certificate cannot be issued for:\n\n- a discarded vehicle, unless a mechanical inspection certificate confirming that the vehicle meets the applicable standards is provided\n- an unregistered hand-crafted vehicle, unless a mechanical inspection certificate confirming that the vehicle meets the applicable standards is provided, or unless the vehicle is a hand-crafted trailer weighing 900 kg or less\n- a severely damaged vehicle, except where the advanced driver assistance systems are being recalibrated\n- an unrebuildable vehicle (total loss)\n- an ATV, a snowmobile or any other vehicle not designed for operation on public roads\n\nThis means that these vehicles must always be towed or transported to be moved.\n\n## Vehicle sold by a dealer\n\nA temporary 10-day registration certificate can be issued by a dealer to allow a vehicle to operate on public roads and be registered at one of our [service outlets](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet).\n\nYou must affix the certificate on the upper left side of the vehicle's rear window and keep the **Attestation de transaction avec un commerçant** form that you received from the dealer in the vehicle.\n\n## Stored vehicle acquired by a dealer, a non-resident of Québec or someone else\n\nWe can issue a temporary 4-day registration certificate if any of the following applies to your vehicle:\n\n- it is registered to be used exclusively on a private road\n- it has been acquired in Québec by a non-resident\n- it has been stored and now needs to be repaired, modified, weighed, checked or inspected\n- it belongs to a duly licensed dealer\n- it has been sold by a duly licensed dealer or a manufacturer for delivery purposes\n\n### To request a 4-day certificate\n\nCome to one of our [service outlets](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet) and present the following documents:\n\n- your driver's licence or another official photo ID document\n\nAND\n\n- one of the following documents:\n  -
