There is a slight distinction between the two!**\n\nIf the “scooter” has an engine with an engine displacement of more than 50 cc, it is automatically considered a “motorcycle.” To drive it, it is mandatory that you hold a Class 6A, 6B or 6C [motorcycle driver's licence](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/obtaining-licence/motorcycle-6a-6b-6c-6e/motorcycle-classes-6a-6b-6c) based on the engine displacement.\n\n## Eligibility\n\n- ### Forms\n\n  - [Consent of a Person Having Parental Authority⁠Ce lien s'ouvrira dans une nouvelle fenêtre](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/formulaires/parental-authority-form.pdf)\n  - [Family Contract – Moped or Scooter DriversCe fichier n’est pas conforme au standard sur l’accessibilité des sites Web.⁠Ce lien s'ouvrira dans une nouvelle fenêtre](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/family-contract-scooter-drivers.pdf)\n\nTo obtain a [Class 6D](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/drivers-licence-classes) licence, you must:\n\n- have your principal residence in Québec\n- have Canadian citizenship or the right to stay in Canada for more than 6 months\n- be at least 14 years of age\n- have the written consent of your father, mother or legal guardian, if you are under age 18\n\n### If you hold a driver's licence issued outside Québec\n\nSee the [Canadian or Foreign Driver’s Licence](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/canadian-foreign-drivers-licence) page to find out to proceed.\n\n## Registering for the driving course\n\nWe recommend that you consult the [Illness or Functional Impairment Checklist (PDF, 99.0 KB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/illness-functional-impairment-checklist.pdf) before registering for a driving course.\n\n### Mandatory driving course\n\nYou are required to complete a 6-hour driving course to learn how to operate a moped or scooter.\n\nThe driving course must be taken at a [driving school recognized](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/finding-recognized-driving-school) by the SAAQ.
