These vehicles and their drivers are subject to specific rules set out in the Regulation.\n\nNote that transporting school children between school and home using these types of vehicles is strictly prohibited.\n\nFor more details, consult the website of the [Ministère des Transports⁠ ⁠](https://www.transports.gouv.qc.ca/en/Pages/Home.aspx).\n\n## Characteristics of vehicles used for school transportation\n\n### School buses and school minibuses\n\nTo ensure that school buses and minibuses can be seen when school children get on or off by the side of the road, buses and minibuses used in Québec must be equipped with at least the following safety features, as prescribed by the _Regulation respecting road vehicles used for the transportation of school children_:\n\n- a body painted yellow\n- the word “ÉCOLIERS” painted across the front and rear\n- a retractable stop sign on the left side of the vehicle\n- flashing red lights in the front and rear\n- alternately flashing yellow lights in the front and rear\n\nSchool buses and school minibuses must also meet the standards regarding use, construction and furnishings set forth in the following:\n\n- [Regulation respecting safety standards for road vehicles](http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cr/C-24.2,)\n- [Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations⁠ ⁠](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._1038/page-1.html) (Transport Canada)\n- [Standard D250⁠ ⁠](https://www.csagroup.org/store/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_szM57rA9QIVdcmUCR0GZARWEAAYASAAEgK_SvD_BwE) (Canadian Standards Association)\n\n#### After 12 years of use…\n\nA bus or minibus greater than 12 years of age may no longer be used for school transportation, as specified in the [Regulation respecting student transportation](http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cr/I-13.3,).\n\n#### Transportation of school children with disabilities\n\nBuses and minibuses used for the transportation of school children with disabilities must also meet certain construction and furnishing specifications prescribed in the [Regulation respecting road vehicles adapted for the transportation of handicapped persons⁠ ⁠](http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cr/C-24.2,%20r.%2051).\n\n### Automobiles\n\nAutomobiles (sedan type) used for the transportation of school children must be equipped with:\n\n- at least 4 and not more than 9 seat belts\n- a hard roof\n- at least 3 side doors with windows\n\n#### On the roof of the vehicle\n\nFrom side to side across the middle of the roof, the vehicle must be equipped with:\n\n- a yellow sign bearing the word “ÉCOLIERS”\n- OR\n- a yellow dome light on which the word “ÉCOLIERS” is displayed in black letters\n\nFor more details, consult the [Regulation respecting road vehicles used for the transportation of school children⁠ ⁠](http://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cr/I-13.3,%20r.%2012).\n\n#### Taxis used for school transportation\n\nWhen a taxi is used for school transportation under a contract for the exclusive purpose of transporting school children, its owner must replace **the taxi dome light with an “ÉCOLIERS” dome light**, or with a **yellow sign** bearing the word **“ÉCOLIERS”**.\n\nThe vehicle thus becomes a sedan-type school transportation vehicle that must comply with the _Regulation respecting road vehicles used for the transportation of school children._\n\n## Mechanical maintenance of vehicles used for school transportation\n\nA periodic mechanical inspection must be carried out by an [SAAQ-authorized road vehicle inspection agent](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet) **every 6 months**, regardless of the type of vehicle used.\n\nIf the vehicle is deemed compliant, a mechanical inspection certificate is issued and an **inspection sticker** is affixed to the vehicle.\n\n### If minor defects are detected\n\nRepairs must be made within 48 hours and meet the requirements of our road vehicle inspection agents.\n\n### If major defects are detected\n\nThe vehicle is prohibited from road use until the repairs have been made to the satisfaction of our road vehicle inspection agents.\n\n### Preventive Maintenance Program (PMP)\n\nVehicle owners may implement a [Preventive Maintenance Program](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program) and have it recognized by the SAAQ to be released from the requirement of submitting their vehicles to periodic mechanical inspections. The choice is theirs to make.\n\n### Other mechanical maintenance requirements may apply\n\nRefer to the detailed information based on the type of vehicle used:\n\n- [buses and minibuses](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/mechanical-inspection-and-maintenance)\n\n**School buses and school minibuses are considered heavy vehicles**\n\nAs a result, owners, operators and drivers must meet several .\n\n### School transportation safety\n\nCarrier enforcement officers and police officers are mandated to ensure school transportation safety. Among other things, they monitor vehicle compliance and use.\n\n## Driver obligations\n\n### Driver's licence\n\nDrivers must hold the appropriate [class of licence](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/drivers-licence-classes) for the vehicle they use to carry out school transportation and be in [good health](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/state-health-licence).\n\nThe required class of licence is based on the type of vehicle:\n\n- Class 5: passenger vehicles\n- Class 2: buses designed to carry more than 24 passengers\n- Class 4B: buses and minibuses designed to carry 24 or fewer passengers\n\n#### Zero alcohol\n\nThe zero-alcohol rule applies to anyone who drives or has the care or control of a bus, a minibus or a taxi.\n\n### Certificate of competence\n\nDrivers who carry out school transportation must also hold a **certificate of competence** issued pursuant to the Transport Act.\n\nThere are 2 types of certificates of competence:\n\n- Certificate of competence to **drive a bus or minibus** used for the transportation of school children, which requires:\n  - 15 hours of initial training\n  - 6 hours of retraining every 3 years thereafter\n- Certificate of competence to **drive a sedan-type vehicle** used for the transportation of school children, which requires:\n  - 6 hours of training\n\n#### To follow the training program to be issued a certificate of competence, visit:\n\n- [Centre de formation en transport de Charlesbourg⁠ ⁠](http://www.cftc.qc.ca/) (website in French only)\n- [Centre de formation du transport routier Saint-Jérôme⁠ ⁠](http://www.cftr.ca/) (website in French only)\n\n## Transportation of preschoolers\n\nIf you organize outings for a group of preschool-age children, the following information will help you determine the correct vehicle to use:\n\n### Passenger vehicle\n\n- The vehicle must have a sufficient number of seats equipped with seat belts and anchorage points to ensure each child is properly restrained.\n- Children who are less than 145 cm tall or who are under 9 years of age must be secured in an appropriate car seat that is adapted to their weight and height.\n\n### School bus or school minibus\n\n- Transport Canada recommends that children weighing less than 18 kg (40 lb) or under the age of 4 and a half years be transported in a child seat attached to the school bus’s anchorage system.\n- School buses built since 2007 are equipped with anchorage systems allowing for child safety seats to be attached to school bus seats.\n\n### For more details, consult:\n\n- the document entitled [Transporter des groupes d'enfants de 5 ans ou moins (PDF, 4.4 MB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/transporter-groupes-enfants-5ans-moins.pdf) (in French only)\n- the [Transport Canada⁠ ⁠](https://www.tc.gc.ca/) website\n\n## Seat belts in school buses and minibuses\n\nSchool buses are safe for school-age children, even without seat belts, because they feature a passive safety system known as “compartmentalization.” This system uses the benches and the interior of the bus to create a protective compartment in the event of a collision.\n\nFor more details, go to the [Transport Canada⁠ ⁠](https://www.tc.gc.ca/) website.\n\nLast update: May 17, 2022\n\n- ## Publications\n\n  -
