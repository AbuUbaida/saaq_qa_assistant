Refer to [Registering a vehicle from outside Québec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/vehicle-registration/vehicle-from-outside-quebec) section for more information.\n\n## Temporary licence plate\n\nTo legally operate your vehicle, you must affix your temporary paper licence plate to your vehicle while waiting to receive your metal licence plate in the mail. Your metal plate will be delivered by mail within 10 to 20 business days to the primary address in your SAAQ file.\n\nYour temporary paper licence plate will be issued by the service outlet agent. The temporary paper licence plate must be affixed to the vehicle’s rear window in the top left corner. For vehicles that do not have a rear window, such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, the temporary plate must be affixed in the top left corner of the windshield or to another visible place on the vehicle.\n\n[This video (MP4, 29.8 MB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/images/immatriculation/plaque-provisoire.mp4) shows how.\n\n## Costs and payment\n\n### Registration fees\n\nTo find out the cost to have a vehicle bought or sold by a business registered, visit the [Rates and Fines section](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/comparative-tables). Before receiving your payment notice, you can also use the [calculation tool](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/motorcycle-registration-cost-estimator) to get an estimate of the amount you will have to pay to renew your motorcycle registration.\n\n### Payment options\n\nAt our service outlets, we accept payment:\n\n- in cash\n- by Interac (debit card)—not available at some service outlets\n- by one or more [pre-authorized debits](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/online-services/citizens/payment-pre-authorized-debits) (a cheque specimen must be provided)\n- by cheque or money order\n\n**Payment by credit card is not accepted.**\n\n### Payment of the GST and QST\n\nWhether the vehicle is new or used, the buyer must pay the GST and QST if the vehicle was bought from a dealership, business or self-employed worker registered for the GST and QST.\n\nIf the vehicle is purchased from an individual, the buyer is only required to pay the QST.\n\nFor more information on the payment or collection of taxes, phone [Revenu Québec⁠ ⁠](https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/contact-us/).\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe business that has purchased the vehicle must have a civil liability insurance policy contracted from a private insurer providing minimum coverage of $50,000. The minimum is $1 million if the business owns or operates heavy vehicles and $2 million if it hauls hazardous materials.\n\nIf the business is not insured and one of its vehicles is involved in a traffic accident that causes more than $500 in damage to the property of another party:\n\n- all of its vehicles may be prohibited from road use\n- it will be assessed a fine that varies depending on the type of vehicle\n\n**The seller remains the owner and liable for the vehicle until...**\n\nThe vehicle is registered in the buyer's name.\n\nThis means that should the buyer commit an offence or be involved in an accident with a vehicle that is still registered in the seller's name, it is the seller who would be held responsible.\n\nLast update: July 15, 2025\n\n- ## Contact us\n\n\n\n\nQuébec area: 418-643-7620\n\nMontréal area: 514-873-7620\n\nElsewhere: 1-800-361-7620 (Québec, Canada, United States)\n\n- ## Find us\n\n  - [Find a Service Outlet](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet/?tx_lbopointsdeservice_ajaxpds%5Bsujet%5D=361&cHash=e73e1ee65f183f04497541d9c818d2f3)\n  - [Find a Mechanical Inspection Centre](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/find-service-outlet/?tx_lbopointsdeservice_ajaxpds%5Bsujet%5D=458&cHash=cf96cfc4331aaad31874dba93d135989)\n- ## Online services\n\n  - [Checking if a Vehicle Can Be Registered](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/online-services/citizens/checking-vehicle-registered)\n- ## Costs\n\n  - [Cost of registration based on the type of vehicle](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/saaq/rates-fines/vehicle-registration/cost-renewal)\n- ## Forms\n\n  - [Vehicle Record Request (PDF, 218.5 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/formulaires/vehicle-record-request.pdf)\n- ## Publications\n\n  - [Don't Fall for Stories (PDF, 1,015.0 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/dont-fall-stories.pdf)\n  - [Liability Insurance for Property Damage (PDF, 195.1 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/property-damage-liability-insurance.pdf)\n  - [Pay Your Fines to Keep Your Driving and Operating Privileges (PDF, 284.9 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/pay-fines-keep-operating-privileges.pdf)\n  - [Registering a Co-Owned Vehicle Fact Sheet (PDF, 137.2 KB)⁠ ⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/publications/registering-co-owned-vehicle-fact-sheet.pdf)\n- ## See also\n\n  - [Registering a Vehicle from Outside Québec](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/vehicle-registration/vehicle-from-outside-quebec)\n  - [Registering an Electric vehicle or Plug-in hybrid vehicle](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/vehicle-registration/registering-vehicle/electric-plug-in-hybrid-hydrogen-vehicle)\n  - [Calculation tool – Motorcycle registration](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/motorcycle-registration-cost-estimator)\n- ## Other websites\n\n  - [Registre des droits personnels et réels mobiliers⁠ ⁠](https://www.rdprm.gouv.qc.ca/) (in French only)\n  - [Bureau des infractions et amendes⁠ ⁠](https://www.amendes.qc.ca/RPVVirtuel/Page_accueil_bia.asp?Lang=English&strAnn=true)\n- ## Laws and regulations\n\n  - [Highway Safety Code⁠ ⁠](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-24.2)\n  - [Automobile Insurance Act⁠ ⁠](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/A-25)\n  - [Regulation respecting road vehicle registration⁠ ⁠](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cr/C-24.2,%20r.%2029)\n  - [Regulation respecting safety standards for road vehicles⁠ ⁠](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cr/C-24.2,%20r.%2032)\n\n## Safety first, on the road and online\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy.
