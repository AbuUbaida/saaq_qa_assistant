Take the time to carefully read the question.\n2. Expand the illustration if needed by clicking on it. It will then fill the entire screen.\n3. Take the time to carefully analyze the illustration to decode all the information it contains:\n\n- Look closely at what each vehicle is doing and identify any potential traffic offences based on what you know about traffic rules and signals, road signs and road-sharing principles;\n- identify which vehicles are being referred to in each statement (each vehicle is assigned its own number).\n\n1.
