We are here to help you with the transfer of ownership.\n\n_**NOTE:** While “ **estate**” is the more common term, “succession” is used in this text, as it is the term used in Québec legislation._\n\nWe offer you our sincerest condolences. Rest assured that we will do everything possible to help you through this process at this trying time.\n\n## What you should know\n\nIn order to declare the death and begin procedures, you will need a copy of one of the following documents:\n\n- death certificate issued by the Directeur de l’état civil\n- obituary\n- coroner’s report\n- burial certificate\n\n### Operating the vehicle that belonged to the deceased:\n\nThe liquidator can drive the vehicle while waiting for it to be sold or transferred to a successor as long as the liquidator:\n\n- has the registration certificate modified in the name of the succession of the deceased by filling out the form [Declaration by the Liquidator of the Succession (PDF, 173.5 KB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/formulaires/declaration-transfer-ownership-death.pdf).\n- changes, if necessary, the address on file to that of the liquidator\n- informs the insurance company.\n- pays the registration fees (if not already paid).\n\n#### To transfer vehicle ownership to a successor or new owner\n\nThe liquidator must:\n\n- fill out the [Declaration by the Liquidator of the Succession (PDF, 173.5 KB)⁠](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/formulaires/declaration-transfer-ownership-death.pdf) form.\n- go to one of our service outlets with the successor or new owner.\n\n### Leased vehicle\n\nIf the deceased’s vehicle is leased, contact the rental company or automobile dealer to find out what steps to follow.\n\nIf the deceased’s driver’s licence was cancelled prior to the request to transfer ownership, no proof of death is required. In this case, the death is considered to have been declared.\n\nTo cancel the deceased’s licence, visit the [Cancelling a Driver's Licence or Relinquishing a Class of Licence](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/vehicle-registration/registering-vehicle-succession-estate) webpage.\n\n### Reimbursement of registration fees\n\nNote that registration fees for unused months may be reimbursed to the succession when the liquidator submits a request to transfer the vehicle’s registration or put the vehicle into storage.\n\nLast update: January 14, 2025\n\n## Safety first, on the road and online\n\nWe are committed to protecting your personal information and privacy.
