When behind the wheel, you must keep your eyes peeled, be attentive to traffic sounds, have good coordination and mobility to be able to turn the steering wheel or check blind spots without making any false moves. You must also be able to perceive danger quickly and make splitsecond decisions. You can see why being in excellent physical and mental condition is an important asset for driving an automobile. Several other factors can affect your ability to drive: illness, stress, fatigue, aging and the consumption of alcohol, drugs or medicine. You must therefore take into account your physical condition before getting behind the wheel. For example, a flu or migraine could negatively affect your driving. Certain injuries to the foot, wrist or arm could even make driving dangerous. Certain illnesses require taking drugs that could hinder the ability to drive. Such is the case with prescription drugs to combat anxiety and allergies, which produce effects similar to those caused by alcohol, including drowsiness or over-stimulation. You should always ask your physician or pharmacist about the effects that medication, whether it is prescribed or bought over the counter, could have on driving.

{"page_content": "Chapter 1 Getting Ready to Drive 22 | Driving a Passenger Vehicle Driving Responsibly You must always bear in mind your safety, that of your passengers and that of other road users. Respecting Your Limits To drive responsibly, both beginner and experienced drivers must know and learn how to respect their limits. For the beginning driver, the main limits involve the ability to see what is around and the ability to anticipate what is ahead. It is one thing to steer properly on a tight turn, something that can be learned with practice and experience, it is another to have seen and prepared for the turn. Moreover, passengers can distract the driver. Should that become a source of stress, the beginner must not hesitate to refuse passengers other than the accompanying driver. The experienced driver could become over-confident and even feel invincible, so be careful not to over-estimate your abilities. Remain alert at all times. Respecting the Right-of-Way Provided for Road Users You must abide by the Highway Safety Code and its traffic rules, including the right-of-way intended to protect the most vulnerable users.

Such actions could compromise your safety or that of other road users. Here are a few simple tips to help you plan your drive: ▶ Get an early start; ▶ Choose the safest route possible for your trip, for example a main road rather than an expressway; ▶ Plan an alternate route in the event of congestion or roadwork; ▶ Listen to weather conditions and traffic information to take another route, if need be; ▶ Consult road condition information services for long drives; ▶ Consult a recent map of the area or region for long drives or when travelling in another region. BB Make only one trip by combining several errands or outings. Short trips do not allow the engine and transmission to reach their peak operating temperature. You have to drive at least 5 km to reach that temperature and only then will fuel consumption and exhaust emissions be reduced. Planning your route ahead of time ensures you know where you are going and prevents unnecessary detours. It is a good habit to develop, even when you are familiar with your route. You can then better focus on the road, drive with more confidence and contribute to everyone's safety.

{"page_content": "Chapter 1 Getting Ready to Drive 34 | Driving a Passenger Vehicle Tires The tires alone ensure the vehicle's contact with the road surface. Good tire traction is essential for vehicle control and passenger safety. The effectiveness of the vehicle's traction or propulsion, steering, suspension and braking will depend in large part on the condition and wear of the tires. Choice of Tires To make the vehicle more stable and safe, use four identical tires, i.e. same construction and size. In Québec, from December 15 through March 15, it is mandatory to equip a passenger vehicle with four winter tires in good condition. However, starting in 2019, vehicle owners will need to have their winter tires installed by December 1. They are designed for maximum traction on snow-covered or icy surfaces. With the return of milder weather, it is recommended to change back to summer or all season tires. Leaving winter tires on a vehicle in summer can reduce gas mileage. In addition, winter tires are not designed for warmer temperatures and the type of rubber used in them wears out more quickly in summer. Tire Maintenance The important thing in tire maintenance is to keep the air pressure in your tires at the level recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.

{"page_content": "Chapter 1 Getting Ready to Drive 1 Driving a Passenger Vehicle | 35 The vehicle will handle better, consume less fuel and be safer if the tires are inflated properly. Remember: ▶ A tire with too much pressure has less traction and a higher risk of punctures; ▶ Insufficient air pressure causes tires to overheat. They could blow and the driver could lose control of the vehicle. In addition, tires that are not inflated enough can increase fuel consumption. The tires' service life can be reduced by as much as 15,00 km. Depending on the distance travelled by the vehicle, the driver could use the tires one or two seasons longer by respecting the air pressure level recommended. BB ▶ Check the air pressure in your tires at least once a month; Always measure the air pressure when the tires are cool, i.e. when the vehicle has not been operated for at least three hours or for a distance of more than 2 km. The more the tires have heated, the greater their pressure; ▶ Have the wheels balanced after replacing tires or rims; ▶ Rotate tires every 10,00 km. That cuts down on the wear and tear, reduces fuel consumption and ensures safe driving with maximum performance. Visibility Features Windows Windows must be clean both inside and out.

You will find a section on preparing an emergency kit in Appendix IV. Regular Checks Regular maintenance, checks and tune-ups before long trips help the vehicle operate safely. Many problems and costly repairs can be avoided through regular vehicle maintenance. A poorly maintained vehicle produces more carbon dioxide (CO 2). It can consume up to 50% more fuel to cover the same distance as a vehicle in perfect condition. It can therefore cause more pollution and contribute to urban smog, acid rain and climate change. BB Regular vehicle maintenance therefore contributes to protecting the environment. Savings are also made possible every year because of lower fuel and vehicle maintenance expenses. For example: ▶ Regular maintenance prevents parts from breaking down earlier than normal. Parts can therefore operate at their highest energy- saving potential; ▶ Regular oil changes ensure that the vehicle operates at its highest potential. Fresh oil lubricates the engine better, which keeps the friction between the metallic parts to a minimum. It also helps to cool the engine and protect it against corrosion.

It therefore allows you to: ▶ Move into the appropriate place; ▶ Drive at a speed that suits road and weather conditions; ▶ Anticipate dangerous situations and react accordingly. To observe means you know how to \"read the road\". Reading the road effectively requires good vision and proper attention. You also need to know how to anticipate what is in front of you and look well ahead. Looking ahead enables you to foresee a dangerous situation and respond early enough to avoid danger. To do this, you can rely on indicators like signs, traffic and parked cars. Importance of Vision Driving a vehicle largely involves gathering information provided by the eyes. To ensure your safety and that of other road users, you must have vision that allows you to: ▶ Clearly distinguish far-away objects; ▶ Evaluate distances, which is very important when you encounter certain dangerous situations such as: ▷ An oncoming vehicle preparing to turn left; ▷ A pedestrian wanting to cross the street without having the right-of-way; ▷ A cyclist suddenly appearing on the right and turning at the next intersection at the same time as you;", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe PDF Library 16.0.3", "creator": "Adobe InDesign 17.0 (Macintosh)", "creationdate": "2022-01-17T09:33:50-05:00", "author": "Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec", "keywords": "driving a vehicle; driver’s license; basic manoeuvres for controlling a vehicle; driving course; controlling the vehicle; sharing the road; driving strategies; preventive attitude; vehicle;", "moddate": "2023-02-03T11:51:22-05:00", "subject": "This guide is for learner drivers looking for information about driving an automobile, including proper techniques and safe conduct on the road.", "title": "Driving a Passenger Vehicle", "trapped": "/False", "source": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/pdf_sources/2_driving_passenger_vehicle.pdf", "total_pages": 264, "page": 54, "page_label": "53", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T23:04:05.989217+00:00", "source_file": "2_driving_passenger_vehicle.pdf", "source_file_id": "2", "source_type": "pdf", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:06:55.042720+00:00", "language": "en", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999952728226289}, "content_length_original": 1357, "content_length_cleaned": 1336, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 1, "document_index": 55}}

When evaluating the risk, you must also take into account the reaction of other road users, especially pedestrians and cyclists.

For example, if there were a collision, an impact on the door of the driver's side rather than on the back fender would increase the driver's risk of being injured.

{"page_content": "Chapter 3 Controlling the Vehicle 3 Driving a Passenger Vehicle | 75 A vehicle gathers speed more easily when going downhill. To prevent it from gathering too much speed, it must be held back by pumping the brake pedal. Before beginning the descent, you may want to shift to a lower gear. That will prevent the brakes from overheating. RR Before going down a steep incline, do not put the gear into neutral. Instead, choose a lower gear so the engine will slow down the vehicle. Inertia Inertia is a natural law by which a motionless body remains at rest unless it is forced to move. To set the body in motion, an external force must be applied to it (for example, pushing or pulling). To change an object's motion, we need to exert an opposite force. For example, we need to apply the brakes to stop a vehicle. A body will continue in a straight line if a force is not applied to change its direction. Therefore, a vehicle will not turn unless the driver turns the steering wheel. When the traction or friction is sufficient, the vehicle can make the turn.

To stop a vehicle, the energy accumulated must first be transmitted to the brakes.

Those factors include the rubbing of moving parts, air resistance and the friction of the tires on the road. Simply releasing the accelerator already causes the vehicle to slow down. It is important to remember that the greater the mass (weight) and speed, two factors that increase a vehicle's kinetic energy, the longer the braking distance.

When a collision appears inevitable, you must slow down as much as possible to reduce the force of impact. It is preferable to avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle. It is important to remember that the vehicle's speed is added to that of the other vehicle.

Since the speed is doubled, the kinetic energy and the force of impact will be quadrupled.

It is therefore important to direct the vehicle toward a least resistant object, for example a cedar hedge, bushes or even a snow bank rather than a pole.

Headlights cannot make up for the lack of daylight. Contrasts are reduced, modifying the perception of depth and movement.

HH When you come within 150 metres of another vehicle, either the one approaching you or the one you are following, you must lower the intensity of your headlights. To read the road well, it is important to look beyond the range of the headlights, i.e. what is lit up by their projection. You must also adopt specific strategies at night.

{"page_content": "Chapter 5 Driving Strategies 5 Driving a Passenger Vehicle | 167 Winter tires provide better traction. The grooves on the tread are roughly 30% deeper than those on all-season tires. Accumulated snow is therefore evacuated more quickly. The rubber is also more flexible and maintains its elasticity up to -40°C. In comparison with winter tires, all-season tires start to harden and lose their elasticity and their traction between -8°C and -15°C. CC To make sure your tires are in good condition, inspect the depth of the tread. BB Check the air pressure in your tires every time the temperature outside changes dramatically, for instance, when it goes from 10°C to -10°C in a short time. In cold weather, the air pressure in tires is reduced, increasing drag caused by snow or melting snow. Regularly checking the air pressure in your tires can reduce fuel consumption. Gas Tank Fuel consumption can increase by 50% in cold weather. The engine takes longer to reach its normal operating temperature, i.e. the temperature at which it runs at peak performance. BB In cold weather, keeping your gas tank full is recommended. It prevents condensation.

Then, you will need to know more than just driving manoeuvres to deal with the situation. Rapid use of your technical skills, combined with your knowledge and judgment and your ability to see clearly and predict events, will help you be prepared to react quickly and well. For instance, a tired driver will take longer to evaluate a situation and will not react as fast as when rested. This is also true of someone who has trouble mastering the braking technique, who will react less effectively in these situations. There are strategies to handle the most frequently encountered emergencies such as mechanical problems, obstacles and complex manoeuvres. To develop indispensable automatic responses for when the time comes, you must: ▶ Recognize emergency situations; ▶ Know the basic strategies so you are not caught off guard; ▶ Master driving techniques.

{"page_content": "Chapter 6 Preventive Attitude 210 | Driving a Passenger Vehicle Eliminating Distractions Distraction at the Wheel Any event or action that diverts drivers' attention from their main task represents a distraction. Although it is impossible to eliminate all distractions while driving, it is important that drivers learn to manage them and reduce their numbers. Some drivers underestimate the amount of attention driving a vehi - cle requires. Driving is a complex task that requires several skills at once. This is why drivers must avoid drinking, eating, smoking, using their cell (to speak or send text messages), or looking at a screen or another device displaying information. In fact, the use of a cell phone or a screen can lead to sanctions. These actions can prevent drivers from concentrating on driving. As a result, they may not perceive hazards and execute certain manoeuvres too late. There are three types of distractions that can prevent you from concentrating on driving the vehicle: ▶ Visual: taking your eyes off the road momentarily to look at something else (the landscape, an accident, etc.); ▶ Physical: taking your hands off the wheel to do something else (handle an object, etc.);", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe PDF Library 16.0.3", "creator": "Adobe InDesign 17.0 (Macintosh)", "creationdate": "2022-01-17T09:33:50-05:00", "author": "Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec", "keywords": "driving a vehicle; driver’s license; basic manoeuvres for controlling a vehicle; driving course; controlling the vehicle; sharing the road; driving strategies; preventive attitude; vehicle;", "moddate": "2023-02-03T11:51:22-05:00", "subject": "This guide is for learner drivers looking for information about driving an automobile, including proper techniques and safe conduct on the road.", "title": "Driving a Passenger Vehicle", "trapped": "/False", "source": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/pdf_sources/2_driving_passenger_vehicle.pdf", "total_pages": 264, "page": 211, "page_label": "210", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T23:04:05.989217+00:00", "source_file": "2_driving_passenger_vehicle.pdf", "source_file_id": "2", "source_type": "pdf", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:06:55.444096+00:00", "language": "en", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999957018891925}, "content_length_original": 1218, "content_length_cleaned": 1203, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 1, "document_index": 212}}
{"page_content": "Chapter 6 Preventive Attitude 6 Driving a Passenger Vehicle | 211 ▶ Intellectual: thinking about something rather than concentrating on the road (your mind is wandering, you are worrying about something, etc.). Obviously, all three types of distraction can be combined to greatly hamper a person's ability to drive. For example, a driver may be thinking about something else while bending over to pick up an object on the passenger seat, and then glance at the seat because he or she can't find the object with his or her hand. These three combined actions considerably increase the risk of being involved in an accident. Distraction-Related Hazards Distractions affect your ability to drive. Unconsciously, you: ▶ React more slowly to traffic conditions; ▶ Are at risk, for example, of not braking in time if a vehicle turns or stops suddenly; ▶ Take longer to notice hazardous situations, such as an object or debris on the road or the unpredictable reactions of a pedestrian or cyclist; ▶ Reduce your safety margin in relation to other road users, which may cause you to take unnecessary risks, such as turning left when there are oncoming vehicles. Drivers must therefore be very alert. They must keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road.

Electronic Devices, a Significant Source of Distraction Many studies have shown that using an electronic device while driving is a major cause of cognitive and visual distractions that increases the risk of being involved in a road accident or violating the Highway Safety Code . The main rule concerning the use of electronic devices or a cell phone is not to use them while driving! Turn off your phone when you are at the wheel and let your voice mail or a passenger take your calls for you. The hands-free option is no safer than the hand-held device, for studies have shown that both have an adverse effect on driving.

False Beliefs Some people think that alcohol is a stimulant. They are wrong. It is a depressant that reduces tension and inhibitions. It makes people more daring, but limits their abilities. Concentration and attention decrease gradually. Ideas become foggy and judgment is impaired. Since alcohol affects all senses and movements, its effects on driving a vehicle are major. Others believe that eating when consuming alcohol eliminates its effects. That is not the case. There is no miracle solution for making alcohol disappear from the blood. Strong coffee can give a person the impression of having more energy, but it does not decrease the alcohol level. Taking a cold shower, walking or dancing won't help either. While it is true that perspiring eliminates some of the alcohol, it is not enough to make a difference.

Give them the bene - fit of the doubt. Keep in mind that everyone can become tense or nervous in certain situations and make mistakes or awkward move - ments.

Some people might also make certain manoeuvres or behave in such a way as to make you think, rightly or wrongly, that they are impatient or aggressive.

Follow the installation instructions for the car seat to: ▶ Correctly secure the car seat to the vehicle's seat; ▶ Properly fasten the child to the car seat. Do not hesitate to have the seat's installation verified. To do so, the Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ), in collaboration with CAA-Québec, has created the Child Car Seat Verification Network. Inspections are performed free of charge by qualified technicians who have received appropriate training based on strict criteria. For additional information, go to siegedauto.qc.ca . It is also important to complete the car seat's registration card and return it to the manufacturer. If there is a recall, the manufacturer will contact the owner of the car seat.

{"page_content": "Driving a Passenger Vehicle | 239 Appendix Appendix Driving with a standard transmission Shifting to a Higher Gear It is preferable to change to a higher gear before the engine turns too quickly. When accelerating, change gears gradually to adjust the engine's power to the vehicle's speed. You have to change gears rapidly but gently. With practice you can master this technique. The way to upshift is the same for all gears: ▶ Ease up on the accelerator gradually; ▶ Apply pressure to the clutch pedal; ▶ Shift into the higher gear; ▶ Ease up on the clutch while accelerating. CC Do not leave your foot on the clutch when not changing gears. The clutch system can wear out more quickly. Choose a gear appropriate to traffic and speed limits. You will therefore be prepared to encounter anything that could happen on the road. Downshifting This manoeuvre is more complicated than shifting to a higher gear. You must downshift as soon as the engine's power is no longer sufficient to maintain the vehicle's speed. When traffic slows, shifting to a lower gear can be enough to reduce the vehicle's speed. Before downshifting you must ensure that the vehicle's speed does not exceed the maximum speed allowed for changing gears.

Four-wheel drive vehicles do not handle like other automobiles. A slight loss of control with a four-wheel drive vehicle can cause an accident. The SUV is high and narrow. Its centre of gravity is higher than that of an automobile. That is why a four-wheel drive is unstable in curves. Loading this type of vehicle can make it even more unstable. The greater the load, the higher the centre of gravity, especially when a load is being carried on the roof. Driving in a straight line with this type of vehicle is usually not a problem. The vehicle does however have a tendency to tip when it is driven too fast in a tight curve. You can then lose control of the brakes when you are in a turn or when the vehicle first starts to skid. The best way to avoid rolling over is to slow down before curves. The four-wheel drive is useful at low speed when it is snowing or when going uphill.
