Your lifestyle also plays a major role! The North American Fatigue Management Program (NAFMP) could be very helpful to you.\n\n## Driver fatigue, in brief\n\nFatigue leads to a gradual decline of physical and mental alertness that can result in drowsiness or sleepiness.\n\nFatigue impairs our faculties, and we often do not even realize it. Just like alcohol, accumulated fatigue reduces our ability to concentrate, affects our judgment and reflexes, and thus impacts our ability to drive.\n\nAlthough all drivers are subject to fatigue at the wheel, heavy vehicle drivers are especially prone to this problem, in particular due to:\n\n- long work hours\n- irregular schedules\n- night shifts\n- the long distances covered\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFatigue is one of the leading causes of death on our roads, along with alcohol, speeding and distraction.\n\n### Recognizing the signs of fatigue\n\nSome signs don't lie:", "metadata": {"title": "Heavy Vehicle Drivers and Fatigue - SAAQ", "description": "To prevent driver fatigue, you cannot rely solely on legislation governing driving and off-duty time.

Drinking coffee can also help, especially if it is consumed before the nap\n- take an extended break and do a few simple physical exercises\n- notify your manager of your state of fatigue\n\n## To manage your fatigue on a daily basis\n\nFatigue cannot be controlled. You cannot simply \"decide\" to be less tired.
