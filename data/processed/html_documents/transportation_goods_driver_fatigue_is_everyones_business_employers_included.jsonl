The decisions made by the various parties involved in the freight and passenger transportation industry can cause fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers.\n\n## Driver fatigue, in brief\n\nFatigue leads to a gradual decline of physical and mental alertness that can result in drowsiness or sleepiness.\n\nFatigue impairs our faculties, and we often do not even realize it. Just like alcohol, accumulated fatigue reduces our ability to concentrate and affects our judgment and reflexes, therefore impacting our ability to drive.\n\nAlthough all drivers are subject to fatigue at the wheel, heavy vehicle drivers are especially prone to this problem, in particular due to:\n\n- long work hours\n- irregular schedules\n- night shifts\n- the long distances covered\n\n**Did you know?**\n\nFatigue is one of the leading causes of death on our roads, along with alcohol, speeding and distraction.\n\n## Operators, owners and employers: you also have a part to play\n\nYou cannot rely solely on legislation governing [driving and off-duty time](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driving-off-duty-time-owners-operators) to prevent driver fatigue-related accidents. Your decisions and your actions can also help reduce fatigue for heavy vehicle drivers.", "metadata": {"title": "Driver Fatigue Is Everyone's Business – Employers Included - SAAQ", "description": "Fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers is everyone's business – employers included.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driver-fatigue-is-everyones-business-employers-included", "language": "en", "keywords": "heavy vehicle, heavy truck, truck driver, trucker, driver, truck operator, truck owner, truck, nafmp, fatigue, fatigue management, asleep, sleep, fatigue management program, SAAQ fatigue program, north american fatigue management program", "robots": null, "og_title": "Driver fatigue", "og_description": "Fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers is everyone's business – employers included.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driver-fatigue-is-everyones-business-employers-included", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driver-fatigue-is-everyones-business-employers-included", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be627-99d6-718d-80b0-35fe91ade3dc", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "basic", "timezone": null, "cache_state": "hit", "cached_at": "2026-01-22T13:33:14.079Z", "credits_used": 1, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "og:description": "Fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers is everyone's business – employers included.", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driver-fatigue-is-everyones-business-employers-included", "og:type": "website", "og:title": "Driver fatigue", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "author": "SAAQ", "twitter:title": "Driver fatigue", "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/driver-fatigue-is-everyones-business-employers-included", "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "dcterms.description": "Fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers is everyone's business – employers included.", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "twitter:description": "Fatigue among heavy vehicle drivers is everyone's business – employers included.", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:41:53.458485+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:48.274649+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999984309662185}, "content_length_original": 6320, "content_length_cleaned": 6290, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 5, "document_index": 1}}
