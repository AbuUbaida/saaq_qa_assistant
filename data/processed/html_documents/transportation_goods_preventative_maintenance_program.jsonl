It is the owner's choice whether to do so.\n\n## Usefulness of a PMP and how it works\n\nA PMP is an effective way of ensuring that vehicles remain safe at all times for all road users.\n\nVehicle owners with a registered PMP may do their own servicing or contract the work out to a third party, but they are responsible for seeing that the work is done correctly and at the proper intervals.\n\n## During preventative maintenance\n\nPreventative maintenance allows mechanics to carry out inspections and make changes or adjustments.\n\nIf the mechanic detects an anomaly that may lead to the improper working order of a component before the next servicing, he or she must immediately make the necessary repairs, changes or adjustments, or plan to do so before the next servicing.", "metadata": {"title": "Preventative Maintenance Program (PMP) - SAAQ", "description": "Heavy vehicle owners may have their preventative maintenance program (PMP) recognized to be exempted from mandatory periodic mechanical inspections.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program", "language": "en", "keywords": "heavy vehicle, heavy truck, hvoo, preventative, maintenance, mechanical, owner, truck, trailer, pmp", "robots": null, "og_title": "Preventative Maintenance Program (PMP)", "og_description": "Heavy vehicle owners may have their preventative maintenance program (PMP) recognized to be exempted from mandatory periodic mechanical inspections.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be622-0a92-77de-a225-eb011c83e389", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "stealth", "timezone": "America/New_York", "cache_state": null, "cached_at": null, "credits_used": 5, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program", "og:title": "Preventative Maintenance Program (PMP)", "og:type": "website", "twitter:title": "Preventative Maintenance Program (PMP)", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/preventative-maintenance-program", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "author": "SAAQ", "twitter:card": "summary", "twitter:description": "Heavy vehicle owners may have their preventative maintenance program (PMP) recognized to be exempted from mandatory periodic mechanical inspections.", "dcterms.description": "Heavy vehicle owners may have their preventative maintenance program (PMP) recognized to be exempted from mandatory periodic mechanical inspections.", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og:description": "Heavy vehicle owners may have their preventative maintenance program (PMP) recognized to be exempted from mandatory periodic mechanical inspections.", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "indexId": "cd35c426-e66f-4dfc-b337-5b0feda76ff1", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:35:48.401338+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:48.384060+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999945424377057}, "content_length_original": 9834, "content_length_cleaned": 9769, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 9, "document_index": 1}}
