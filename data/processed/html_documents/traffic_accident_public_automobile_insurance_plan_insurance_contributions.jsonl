{"page_content": "## Why does the insurance contribution applicable to a licence vary from one person to another?\n\nThe insurance contribution for a driver's licence may vary depending on the licence class you hold. For example, the amount you have to pay is different if you have a Class 5 (passenger vehicle) or Class 6 (motorcycle) licence. The number of demerit points in your record also affects the amount of your insurance contribution.\n\n## Why does the insurance contribution applicable to vehicle registration vary from one person to another?\n\nThe insurance contribution for vehicle registration varies depending on the category to which your vehicle belongs. Each vehicle category is associated with different accident risks and compensation costs. You must therfore pay the compensation costs generated by each category of vehicle you register.\n\n## How are insurance contributions calculated?\n\nContributions are determined on the basis of risk, that is, on the number of people killed or injured and the cost to compensate victims in the various categories.\n\nFor example, the insurance contribution is higher for the motorcycle category than for the passenger vehicle category, because there are proportionally more fatalities and injuries in the motorcycle category. Furthermore, there are fewer motorcycle owners than passenger vehicle owners. As a result, there are fewer people to share insurance contribution costs in this category.", "metadata": {"title": "Insurance Contributions  - SAAQ", "description": "The SAAQ determines the amounts of the insurance contributions collected from driver's licence and vehicle registration payments and transferred to the Fonds d’assurance.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/traffic-accident/public-automobile-insurance-plan/insurance-contributions", "language": "en", "keywords": "Automobile insurance, Fonds d'assurance, Panel of Experts, public consultation, Québec's automobile insurance plan, public automobile insurance plan, public auto insurance plan", "robots": null, "og_title": "Insurance Contributions", "og_description": "The SAAQ determines the amounts of the insurance contributions collected from driver's licence and vehicle registration payments and transferred to the Fonds d’assurance.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/traffic-accident/public-automobile-insurance-plan/insurance-contributions", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/traffic-accident/public-automobile-insurance-plan/insurance-contributions", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be61e-e77f-7320-9758-7f93012298ae", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "basic", "timezone": "America/New_York", "cache_state": "miss", "cached_at": null, "credits_used": 1, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "twitter:title": "Insurance Contributions", "og:title": "Insurance Contributions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:description": "The SAAQ determines the amounts of the insurance contributions collected from driver's licence and vehicle registration payments and transferred to the Fonds d’assurance.", "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/traffic-accident/public-automobile-insurance-plan/insurance-contributions", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/traffic-accident/public-automobile-insurance-plan/insurance-contributions", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "dcterms.description": "The SAAQ determines the amounts of the insurance contributions collected from driver's licence and vehicle registration payments and transferred to the Fonds d’assurance.", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:description": "The SAAQ determines the amounts of the insurance contributions collected from driver's licence and vehicle registration payments and transferred to the Fonds d’assurance.", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "author": "SAAQ", "og:type": "website", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "indexId": "d67b4405-81b0-4be6-814e-1342e321238c", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:32:23.499540+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:48.220187+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999961541274899}, "content_length_original": 13045, "content_length_cleaned": 13027, "start_index": 6651, "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 10, "document_index": 1}}
