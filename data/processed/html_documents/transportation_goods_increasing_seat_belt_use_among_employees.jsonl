In the event of an accident, wearing a seat belt cuts the risk of death or serious injury in half.\n\n## Consequences of an accident for your business\n\nWhen any of your heavy vehicle drivers are killed or injured during a traffic accident, this can have serious consequences for your business. For example, an injured or deceased driver can lead to:\n\n- other drivers having to work extra hours to compensate for an absent driver\n- the loss of knowledge or expertise that is difficult to replace\n- efforts being required to recruit new drivers as temporary or permanent employees\n- a loss of productivity during the period required to replace and train a new driver\n- possible difficulties in meeting deadlines and delivery schedules\n- legal fees\n- a possible increase in the contribution related to labour standards (for the financing of the Commission des normes, de l'équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail)\n- a possible increase in your commercial insurance premiums\n- damage to your business's reputation and the loss of contracts\n- a drop in employee morale and motivation\n\n## Penalties", "metadata": {"title": "Increasing Seat Belt Use Among Employees - SAAQ", "description": "Recommendations to increase seat belt use among employees and improve the business’s record.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/increasing-seat-belt-use-among-employees", "language": "en", "keywords": "seat belt, HVOO’s record, business’s record, seat belt use, wearing a seat belt, prevention program, owner, operator, employer, heavy vehicle", "robots": null, "og_title": "Increasing Seat Belt Use Among Employees", "og_description": "Recommendations to increase seat belt use among employees and improve the business’s record.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/increasing-seat-belt-use-among-employees", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/increasing-seat-belt-use-among-employees", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be621-2b6f-733d-8836-4b28849e159c", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "basic", "timezone": null, "cache_state": "hit", "cached_at": "2026-01-22T13:33:54.384Z", "credits_used": 1, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "author": "SAAQ", "og:description": "Recommendations to increase seat belt use among employees and improve the business’s record.", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "og:type": "Increasing Seat Belt Use Among Employees", "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:description": "Recommendations to increase seat belt use among employees and improve the business’s record.", "dcterms.description": "Recommendations to increase seat belt use among employees and improve the business’s record.", "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/increasing-seat-belt-use-among-employees", "og:title": "Increasing Seat Belt Use Among Employees", "twitter:title": "Increasing Seat Belt Use Among Employees", "twitter:card": "summary", "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/transportation-goods/increasing-seat-belt-use-among-employees", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:34:51.977334+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:48.330442+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999975611734874}, "content_length_original": 4803, "content_length_cleaned": 4801, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 4, "document_index": 1}}
