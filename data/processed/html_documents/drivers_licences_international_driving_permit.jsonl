Do you hold a Québec driver's licence and want to drive outside Canada? You might need an international driving permit.\n\nAn international driving permit is a \"translation\" of your driver's licence and must be obtained in the country that issued your driver's licence. This permit specifies-according to an internationally recognized classification-the types of vehicles you are authorized to drive.\n\nYou must apply for an international driving permit before coming to Québec.\n\n**An international driving permit does not replace the driver's licence issued by your country of origin-it is used in combination with your licence.**\n\nTo be valid, an international driving permit must always be accompanied by your original driver's licence. In the event of a roadside check, you must show both documents.\n\n## You hold a foreign driver's licence\n\nYou are allowed to drive on Québec roads with your foreign driver's licence for six months, provided the licence is valid.
