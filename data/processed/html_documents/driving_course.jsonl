It recognizes schools that can offer driving courses for the purposes of obtaining a driver's licence. It also supports students should their driving school close, be sold, or have its recognition revoked. The SAAQ also processes complaints received regarding driving schools.\n\n## Driving schools recognized by the SAAQ\n\nOnly driving schools recognized by the SAAQ offer the programs that are mandatory for obtaining a driver's licence. [Find a recognized driving school](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/driving-course/finding-recognized-driving-school).\n\nLearn more about the duration and structure of the different driving courses.
