It is important to pay attention when a bus is backing up.\n\n### Motor coaches\n\n![Illustration showing the blind spots in front of, on both sides of, and behind a motor coach](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/blob/saaq/documents/images/securite_routiere/angles_morts_autocar.jpg)\n\n1. **In front:** the front blind spot is similar to that of a city bus because of the flat front. However, a motor coach's driver's compartment is higher, making its blind spots bigger.\n2. **On the sides:** because of the motor coach's significant size and height, its side blind spots cover a large area.\n3. **At the rear:** the rear blind spot is very long because motor coaches do not have rear windows.\n\n### Video clip\n\nBy clicking on the video, you will change the context of this page.\n\n#### Heavy vehicle blind spots - Cars _(French only)_", "metadata": {"title": "In a Heavy Vehicle - SAAQ", "description": "Speed limiters, blind spots, driver fatigue: driving a heavy vehicle is subject to obligations and requires special knowledge.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/heavy-vehicle", "language": "en", "keywords": "road safety, heavy vehicle, truck, trailer, truck speed limiter, speed limiter", "robots": null, "og_title": "Heavy Vehicles", "og_description": "Speed limiters, blind spots, driver fatigue: driving a heavy vehicle is subject to obligations and requires special knowledge.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/heavy-vehicle", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/heavy-vehicle", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be620-c3d1-74bc-ad61-465479eaa00f", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "stealth", "timezone": "America/New_York", "cache_state": null, "cached_at": null, "credits_used": 5, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "author": "SAAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:type": "website", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "dcterms.description": "Speed limiters, blind spots, driver fatigue: driving a heavy vehicle is subject to obligations and requires special knowledge.", "twitter:title": "Heavy Vehicles", "og:description": "Speed limiters, blind spots, driver fatigue: driving a heavy vehicle is subject to obligations and requires special knowledge.", "og:title": "Heavy Vehicles", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/heavy-vehicle", "twitter:card": "summary", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "twitter:description": "Speed limiters, blind spots, driver fatigue: driving a heavy vehicle is subject to obligations and requires special knowledge.", "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/heavy-vehicle", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "indexId": "76700bcc-e405-43de-9536-863c56be94ea", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:34:24.739581+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:48.130045+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.9999975887005965}, "content_length_original": 12829, "content_length_cleaned": 12785, "start_index": 4873, "chunk_index": 5, "total_chunks": 11, "document_index": 1}}
