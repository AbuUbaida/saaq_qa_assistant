The number of points varies based on the type of licence and the driver's age.\n\n## Demerit point system\n\nIn Québec, a demerit point system establishes the number of points that any driver or passenger accumulates if found guilty of [certain offences](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points/offences-and-demerit-points).\n\nDemerit points are entered on a driving record when an individual is convicted of an offence. When the number of demerit points accumulated is equal to or greater than the applicable threshold, the driver's licence is revoked or the right to obtain a licence is suspended.\n\n**Licence holders can have points entered on their driving record even if they are not behind the wheel. The same rule applies to individuals who do not hold a driver's licence.**\n\nFor example, a passenger not wearing a seat belt or someone holding onto a vehicle in motion is subject to demerit points in addition to a fine.\n\nDemerit point brackets are determined on the basis of:\n\n- the type of licence: driver's licence, learner's licence or probationary licence\n- the driver's age\n- whether the driver holds a licence\n\n### 4-point bracket", "metadata": {"title": "Demerit Points - SAAQ", "description": "In Québec, all individuals who drive a vehicle are subject to a system of demerit points that accumulate when they are found guilty of an offence.", "url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points", "language": "en", "keywords": "demerit points, licence revocation, offence, points and offences, demerit point threshold", "robots": null, "og_title": "Demerit Points", "og_description": "In Québec, all individuals who drive a vehicle are subject to a system of demerit points that accumulate when they are found guilty of an offence.", "og_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points", "og_image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "og_audio": null, "og_determiner": null, "og_locale": null, "og_locale_alternate": null, "og_site_name": "SAAQ", "og_video": null, "favicon": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/favicon.ico", "dc_terms_created": null, "dc_date_created": null, "dc_date": null, "dc_terms_type": null, "dc_type": null, "dc_terms_audience": null, "dc_terms_subject": null, "dc_subject": null, "dc_description": null, "dc_terms_keywords": null, "modified_time": null, "published_time": null, "article_tag": null, "article_section": null, "source_url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points", "status_code": 200, "scrape_id": "019be618-e85a-77d8-997a-e08b9cd34218", "num_pages": null, "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "proxy_used": "basic", "timezone": "America/New_York", "cache_state": "miss", "cached_at": null, "credits_used": 1, "concurrency_limited": false, "concurrency_queue_duration_ms": null, "error": null, "twitter:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points", "og:title": "Demerit Points", "twitter:description": "In Québec, all individuals who drive a vehicle are subject to a system of demerit points that accumulate when they are found guilty of an offence.", "dcterms.creator": "SAAQ", "og:url": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/drivers-licences/demerit-points", "generator": "TYPO3 CMS", "og:type": "website", "dcterms.description": "In Québec, all individuals who drive a vehicle are subject to a system of demerit points that accumulate when they are found guilty of an offence.", "author": "SAAQ", "og:site_name": "SAAQ", "og:description": "In Québec, all individuals who drive a vehicle are subject to a system of demerit points that accumulate when they are found guilty of an offence.", "og:image": "https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/_assets/3137b1a864c689786cac76b3def62dd1/Assets/img/og.png", "twitter:card": "summary", "twitter:site": "SAAQ", "twitter:title": "Demerit Points", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "facebook-domain-verification": "1en4okgbj220os0h290a52lpwyie3b", "indexId": "a0a729fc-6c76-4d66-8060-e509899f1244", "collected_at": "2026-01-22T14:25:50.543508+00:00", "source_type": "html", "source_file": "/home/andalus/self_study/projects/saaq_qa_assistant/data/raw/html_sources/urls.txt", "source_file_id": "/home/andalus/self", "cleaned_at": "2026-01-22T23:08:47.889220+00:00", "language_scores": {"en": 0.999995757517494}, "content_length_original": 8330, "content_length_cleaned": 8305, "start_index": 0, "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 7, "document_index": 1}}
