Use our tool to [simulate the number of instalments](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/online-services/citizens/simulating-pre-authorized-debits) and estimate their amount.\n- By a cheque mailed to the following address:\n\nSociété de l'assurance automobile du Québec\n\nCase postale 19100, succursale Terminus\n\nQuébec (Québec) G1K 8J6\n\n### Payment deadline and bimonthly pre-authorized debits\n\nPay by the deadline indicated on the notice.\n\n**Avoid paying these additional fees**\n\n- For late payment (minimum fee, may vary according to the situation): $13.50\n- For each NSF cheque: $35.00\n- For each rejected pre-authorized debit: $35.00 (if these fees are debited twice for the same payment, contact the SAAQ to receive a reimbursement)\n\nChange: If you had chosen bimonthly pre-authorized debits (6 instalments per year), please note that this option is no longer available.
